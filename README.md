# Bandcamp-Spider

A spider which downloads the preview versions of songs from bandcamp in MP3 format with a (low) bitrate of 128kb/s.

The current version of this is very dirty hack. It does have a tendency to crash with some song names (ones with reserved or special characters in the url) and is generally unstable with some crashes that I have yet to determine the cause of. I might fix this and clean the code up in the future, but for now it works (mostly).
